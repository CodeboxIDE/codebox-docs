## Accounts

Codebox lets you connect accounts from GitHub, Bitbucket and Assembla.

### Import Repositories

After login with one of the previous services, you can create boxes workspaces for your repositories hosted on GitHub/Bitbucket/Assembla.

### Unlink Accounts

When you add an account to Codebox, it simply add your Codebox public SSH key to authorized keys on the service. To unlink a service, remove the key from the authorized keys:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/ssh)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/SamyPesse/ssh-keys/)
* [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/user/edit/edit_git_settings)
